ElectrumSV is a fork of the open source Electrum Bitcoin wallet (www.electrum.org) for
Bitcoin SV.  It continues on from the Electron Cash fork from the Electrum 2.9.0 codebase,
which continues to work with Bitcoin Cash, which like Bitcoin Core retains the Bitcoin
name while no longer following the Bitcoin design from the whitepaper.  Bitcoin SV is the
only real Bitcoin following the whitepaper.

The ElectrumSV software is NOT affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Electrum,
electrum.org or the Electrum developers.  Likeswise neither with Electron Cash.

If you are concerned about running ElectrumSV binaries you can always install and/or run
it from the Github source directly.  However, all binaries are GPG signed, and SHA256
hashes are provided, with both hashes and signatures being checked into the Github
repository -- published through separate means and on separate web sites from the
binaries.  The Windows builds are also created deterministically and it should be possible
for users to verify that the source they should have been created from, is exactly the
source they were created from.  So, there are several tools in a users hands that allow
them to ascertain they can trust the builds and binaries provided.


Usage
-----

When you first run ElectrumSV it will use a different configuration directory to Electrum
or Electron Cash.  On Unix it is "~/.electrum-sv", and on Windows/MacOS it is "ElectrumSV".
The first time you run ElectrumSV, you will be given the option of copying your wallets
from Electron Cash.  Initially transactions will show up as unverified because ElectrumSV
is downloading the blockchain headers to verify the transactions.  This can take a few
minutes, but is only done once.

Ensure you are running ElectrumSV and not Electrum or Electron Cash by checking for
"ElectrumSV" in the title bar wording.

We STRONGLY recommend you get comfortable and only send a small amount of Bitcoin SV coins
at first, to yourself, to confirm the network is processing your transactions as expected.

# Release 1.3.0a1
  * Release guide: https://medium.com/@roger.taylor/electrumsv-1-3-0a1-unstable-2f24c104979e
    It is advised you read the linked guide for a definitive source of information about what
    has changed in this release. Entries in this list are added by developers who make changes
    and are more intended as an overview, for use in the more approachable release guide.
  * Wallets: The wallet format has changed and when you open your wallet it will be backed up
    and upgraded. This is an alpha level change that will change further before final release.
    Wallets will migrate from a JSON-based file, to an sqlite-based database.
  * Keys: Wallets can now have multiple sets of keys, and multiple sub-wallets. Sub-wallets
    can in theory share parent keys, and derive distinct spaces using them for their own use.
  * User interface: The user interface has had minor changes to facilitate access and usage of
    sub-wallets. We currently only create one sub-wallet, so the changes are superficial so far.

# Release 1.2.1
  * Windows: Previously running the ElectrumSV application on Windows would not allow easy access
    to the logging information. In the worst case, the user would just get an error about not being
    able to run the 'electrum-sv' script. With this release it should now be possible to run from
    the command prompt and provide the '--v=debug' option to see why ElectrumSV could not start up.
  * Block explorers: An existing feature we have is that users can select a transaction and choose
    to view it on a block explorer, and can select what block explorer to use in their settings.
    Now you can also choose the 'satoshi.io' explorer in addition to the ones we already offer.

# Release 1.2.0
  * UI: Correctly set the application icon so that it is displayed for all windows. This is possibly
    irrelevant on some operating systems, but on Windows it ensures that the application icon
    featured in the top left-hand corner of the window is not blandly undefined but rather the
    glorious new icon that we have.
  * Wallet creation/restoration: Switch to cointype 0 (Bitcoin) for BIP44-derivations by default.
    145 (BCH) and 236 (BSV) might need to be tried when restoring a wallet.
  * Update checker: The release announcements are now expected to be signed and will only be
    shown to the user if they are, and the signature is that of kyuupichan or rt121212121.
  * Hardware wallets: A warning dialog has been added for hardware device usage highlighting
    the support/quality issues with these devices.
  * Hardware wallets: Trezor and Keepkey have had various UI-related bugs fixed.
  * Hardware wallets: KeepKey users should update their device firmware.
  * Hardware wallets: Digital Bitbox transaction signing now works again and has probably been
    broken since our first release.
  * Hardware wallets: Ledger Nano X has been added as a recognised device. It has not been tested
    as we do not have one, but at least it will now be found.
  * Exchange rates: BSV fiat values can now be obtained via Coinbase.
  * Code quality: Rewrite of the networking code to use asynchronous logic. This allows the code to
    be written in a clearer and more straightforward fashion, and both helps us ensure that it
    works correctly and reduces the chance of bugs.
  * Code quality: Rewrite of the SPV support functionality to work with the new asynchronous
    networking. This includes both the synchronisation of address usage in blockchain transactions
    and verification that located transactions are real and were included in blocks using merkle
    proofs.
  * Code quality: Several cleanups and improvements to internals that increase robustness and
    stability.

# Release 1.1.2
  * When run in portable mode, ElectrumSV would fail to correctly locate the Electron Cash
    wallets directory, and would show the portable mode ElectrumSV wallets as the Electron Cash
    wallets. The Electron Cash portable mode wallet directory is now correctly located.

# Release 1.1.1
  * Do not display raw errors from the server when the user uses the 'Tools / Load Transaction /
    From the blockchain' menu. They are now presented in a way where it is highlighted that
    the actual message can be maliciously replaced by the server, and the user needs to use their
    own good judgement to determine whether the error message is relevant or correct.
  * Added a popup help dialog for the 'Existing Electron Cash wallets detected' message, shown
    on the wallet selection page of the wizard.
  * Added a popup help dialog for the 'I already have a seed' page, shown during the wallet
    creation process in the wizard. This goes into detail about the repercussions of importing
    seeds created in Centbee, Handcash or Moneybutton/Yours, where that seed is still being
    used in those wallets. The gist is that it is not supported, and you're best to check with
    those wallets before doing it.
  * Added a popup dialog confirming how many Electron Cash wallets were imported by the user,
    which will give the user feedback that something actually happened.
  * Include the new logos and icons kindly provided by the Bitcoin Association. Thanks again to
    MrScatman (https://twitter.com/bsmith12251960) for the original icon.
  * Fix a bug where importing or sweeping a private key would error
    (https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/45).
  * Fix a bug in encrypting messages where the user entered a bad public key
    (https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/46).

# Release 1.1.0
  * Check for updated versions on startup, and indicates updates in the wallet UI.
  * Various hardware wallet fixes.  Note hardware wallets may display Bitcoin Cash
    addresses instead of Bitcoin addresses; this is out of our control and pending
    firmware updates.  For similar reasons they may also warn about addresses being
    incorrect for the coin type; these warnings may be ignored.
  * New blockchain parsing and fork handling code, replacing the historically unstable code.
  * Tentative support for file attachments in OP_RETURN pushdatas when sending a transaction.
  * Support for new ?sv style urls, which are also used in QR codes.
  * Console tab improvements and warning.
  * Addition of a preliminary log viewer.
  * Address converter tab removed.  ElectrumSV still accepts Bitcoin Cash "cashaddr"
    addresses but only displays Bitcoin addresses.  A future release will remove support for
    cashaddr entirely.
  * Removal of all plugins.  Two plugins become extensions: cosigner pool, and labelsync.
    Audio modem support has been removed.  Virtual keyboard support is now in all password
    fields.
  * Testnet: testnet now uses the correct tpub, tprv derivations and not mainnet's xpub, xprv
    derivations.
  * Many fixes and internals improvements.

# Release 1.0.0
  * Coin splitting support.
  * Checkpoints locking the blockchain to the Bitcoin SV fork.
  * Bitcoin SV related block explorers.
  * Bitcoin SV related exchange rate services.
